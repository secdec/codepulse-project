Code Pulse is a code coverage tool that works on running programs in real time. It uses the [bytefrog](https://github.com/codedx/bytefrog) tracing framework to monitor your Java applications, and displays its findings on a web-based UI.

Secure Decisions is extending development on the Code Pulse project. You may view or access the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/codedx/codepulse), or visit its [website](http://code-pulse.com/).
